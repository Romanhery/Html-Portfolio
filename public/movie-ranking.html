<h1>The Best Movies According To Roman</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</h3>
<p>It has really amazing graphics and the plot<br />
is really good<br /></p>

<h3> Avatar : The way of the water</h3>
<p> It is emotional and the best graphics
I've ever see. It also has the best plot<br />
out of all the movies I've ever seen.</p>

<h3>Kandahar</h3> 
<p> I love this movie because its setting<br />
is in my home country Afghanistan.<br />
I also like it because
